# Gryffindor house is where you would find the pluckiest and most daring students
# (there’s a reason the house symbol is the brave lion). The house colours are scarlet and gold,
# the common room lies up in Gryffindor Tower and the Head of House is Professor Minerva McGonagall.

# qualities like courage, bravery and determination.
# stand up for the little guy,
# challenges authority,
# has a tendency to act first and think later,
# is known as a class clown and takes board games very seriously.
# Another Weasley, I know just what to do with you - Gryffindor!


# Head of House is Professor Severus Snape
# Merlin himself even belonged to this misunderstood house
# difficult, very difficult
# Plenty of courage of course
# A thirst to prove yourself
# Not a bad mind either
# Not slytherin? you could be great you know? it's all here in your head.
# and slytherin will help you on your way to greatness
# then you are most likely ambitious, shrewd and possibly destined for greatness.
# We can imagine you’re the kind of person who is always one step ahead,
# has a dark sense of humour,
# thinks reputation is important,
# takes pride in their appearance and doesn’t let anyone see their soft side.

# Ravenclaw
# If you are looking for the brainiest students – you would find them in Ravenclaw
# (with a couple of notable exceptions like Hermione Granger).
# The Ravenclaw colours are blue and bronze, the emblem is an eagle, the Head of House is
# Professor Filius Flitwick and the common room sits at the top of Ravenclaw Tower behind an enchanted knocker.
#
# The Sorting Hat would only put you in this house if you demonstrated excellent wisdom,
# wit and a skill for learning. Ravenclaws are often known for being quite eccentric and most of
# the great wizarding inventors and innovators have come from this house.
#
# We can imagine that you would get to sit up in Ravenclaw Tower, while surveying the excellent views,
# if you’re the type of person who analyses everything, is an overachiever, can be described as away
# with the fairies, is not afraid to be an individual and has a head stuffed full of interesting facts.


# Hufflepuff is where you will find the most trustworthy and hardworking students. In fact, out of all the
# houses Hufflepuff has produced the least number of dark witches and wizards. The badger is the symbol of
# this house, the colours are yellow and black, the Head of House is Professor Pomona Sprout and the common
# room can be found near the kitchens in Hogwarts.
#
# There is an idea that Hufflepuffs are the least clever of all Hogwarts students – but that is not true.
# Hufflepuffs are just the most humble of all the houses and don’t feel the need to shout about their
# achievements in the same way as the others.
#
# If you were lucky enough to be sorted into this house, we can imagine you’re the type of person who
# has a strong moral compass, always works hard, is the most loyal friend, knows it is the taking part
# that counts and always has the best snacks.
